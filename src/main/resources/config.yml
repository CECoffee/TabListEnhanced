# HEADER AND FOOTER:
#
# Enable text above the player list in the TabList?
header-enabled: true
# Animation sequence for the header. Use '\n' to create a new line, or edit the template below.
header:
- '&f%img_playerlist_logo%\n\n\n\n\n&f&l当前在线人数&f &l%server_online%\n&f%img_playerlist_background%'
# The rate (in ticks) that the animation sequence above cycles. 20 ticks = 1 second.

#
# Enable text below the player list in the tab?
footer-enabled: true

###
# SORTING:
#
#   The order of the permissions in the list below is the
# order in which players with those permissions will be
# sorted in the TabList.
#
# For example,
#
# sortByPerms:
# - 'tle.c'
# - 'tle.b'
# - 'tle.a'
#
#   In the list above, all players with the permission 'tle.c'
# will be sorted above players with the permissions 'tle.b', who
# will be sorted above players with the 'tle.a' permission. Anyone
# without a permission is set to the bottom and is sorted by username.
#
sortByPerms:
- 'tle.c'
- 'tle.b'
- 'tle.a'
#
# How often should the TabList sort players and check if they have permission to a new Group?
# (Players are auto-sorted upon joining as well)
# (Groups will be instantly updated in Tab when added through the command, this is
#  checking if the player has gained a different 'orHasPermission' permission)
# (Note: this is also how often the player's displayname, 'prefix', and
#  'suffix' is updated if you have 'use-displayname' set to true)
update-sorting-and-groups: 300
#
###


###
# DISPLAY NAMES:
#
# Use players' display/chat names in the TabList?
# (This will make a player's name in the TabList just like their chat name)
use-displayname: false
#
# Add a prefix and/or suffix to the player's display name?
# The 'prefix' and 'suffix' update according to 'update-placeholders' found below
# (Note: this only applies when 'use-displayname' is set to true)
# (Note: THERE IS NOT a 16 character limit for these)
prefix: '&8[&bCLAN&8] &f'
suffix: '&f | &7&lNOVICE'

# GROUPS:
#
# The default group players are placed in to
default-group: 'member'
#
#   Groups give you an easy option to distinguish between players for your TabList!
# Listed below are three example groups to help you get started.
#
#   Assign players to Groups with: /tablistEnhanced set <player> <group>,
#   or by giving them the corresponding 'orHasPermission' permission.
#
# (Note: Groups are not automatically sorted - you'll need to add your own
#  permissions to the 'sortByPerms' section)
groups:
  # Group name
  op:
    # If a player has this permission, they will automatically be added to this Group
    # (This permission is not required! You can also use: /tablistEnhanced set <player> <group>)
    # Remember: Since operators have all permissions, they will by default be assigned to this Group
    # (Higher Groups take priority over lower Groups when multiple permissions are assigned)
    orHasPermission: 'tle.op'
    # Animation sequence specific to this Group
    #
    # Placeholders: %player%, %player_displayname%, and all PlaceholderAPI placeholders
    display:
    - '%img_admin%&f%player%'
  player:
    orHasPermission: 'tle.player'
    display:
    - '%img_player%&f%player%'
#
# The rate (in ticks) that the animation sequence for each Group cycles per player. 20 ticks = 1 second.
